## Description

## Setup/Installation Requirements

*  To clone:
  * git clone https://github.com/doublespoiler/website-recreation-project
  * OR
  * Navigate to the repository, click the "Code" button, and "Download Zip".  You will need to unzip this folder to a place you can access.
* open index.html located in the website-recreation-project-main folder in your web browser or IDE/text editor

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
